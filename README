EFI Swiss Knife
An IDA plugin to improve (U)EFI reversing

Copyright (C) 2016, 2017  Pedro Vila√ßa (fG!) - reverser@put.as - https://reverse.put.as

This is an IDA plugin to assist in (U)EFI binaries reversing.
It is based on original work by Snare - https://github.com/snare/ida-efiutils
Since I hate Python I did something new in C adding some extra features that I wanted.

Tested with IDA 6.9/6.95 Mac OS X version.

To compile for OS X use the Makefile or the XCode Project.

You will need to edit the XCode project and set the paths to the SDK.
(default is to /Applications/IDA Pro 6.95/idasdk695)

You should edit config.h and modify the log and database paths.

Copy EFISwissKnife.pmc64 to /Applications/IDA Pro 6.95/idaq.app/Contents/MacOS/plugins/

By default it only compiles the plugin to the 64 bit version of IDA. If you want the plugin to 32 bit version
you need to edit the Xcode Project and change __EA64__=1 to 0.

To call it from IDA use Shift+F2 and then
1) To display a menu with run options: RunPlugin("EFISwissKnife", 1);
2) To run with default options: RunPlugin("EFISwissKnife", 0);
3) To run in batch mode: RunPlugin("EFISwissKnife", 2);

The plugin supports batch mode in case you want to mass analyse EFI binaries and gather some statistics about services usage.

You probably want to update the GUIDs available at efi_guids.h.

This code is targetting Mac OS X EFI binaries. It should work with other platforms UEFI binaries without problems or with minor
modifications and updates.

Only PE binaries supported, no TE binaries supported yet.

That's it! Enjoy :-)

fG!

v1.0 - Initial version

IDA BUGS:
Another bug is related to the PLUGIN_UNL flag. It is used to "Unload the plugin immediately after calling 'run'.".
If this option is set, it crashes the Windows version. Mac version seems do to fine with it.
